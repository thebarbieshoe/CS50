1.  It's a header file in C which has all the new int types that allows for more code specs.
specify exact width int types and defined min and max allowance

2.  what's the pt of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program.
They are equal respectively to: unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int and unsigned long long.

3.  How many bytes in each?
BYTE: 8 bits (1byte)
DWORD: 32 bits (4bytes)
LONG: 32 bits(4bytes)
LONG LONG: 64 bits (8bytes)
WORD: 16 bits (2 bytes)

4.  B & M in ASCII is the first 2 bits of any BMP file

5.  difference between bfSize and biSize
bfSize is the size of the whole bmp file, which includes the headerfiles, while biSize is the size of the
BITMAPINFOHEADER header file.

6.  what does it mean if biHeight is negative
the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner. ... Top-down DIBs cannot be compressed.

7.  what field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP's color depth? (bits per pixel)
8.  why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c
9.  why is the third argument of fread always 1 in our code
10. what value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
11. what does fseek do
12. what is SEEK_CUR
