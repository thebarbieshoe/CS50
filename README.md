# CS50
These are all of my CS50 assignments.

I began taking the Harvard Course, CS50 in July 2017 and got through the first 5 Problem Sets by September 2017. I got stuck on Pset5 and then had to take a break from the course because of work and personal life obligations. But I have had the best time working on this course! Some Psets can take DAYS, but once I am able to work through them and make my code work... it's an amazing feeling!
