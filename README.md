# CS50
These are all of my CS50 assignments.

INTRO: I began taking the Harvard Course, CS50 in July 2017 and got through the first 5 Problem Sets by September 2017. I got stuck on Pset5 and then had to take a break from the course because of work and personal life obligations. But I have had the best time working on this course! Some Psets can take DAYS, but once I am able to work through them and make my code work... it's an amazing feeling!

CS50 might not be giving me functional skills to get a development job right away, but it's making my think deeper about coding and computers. It makes me think like an actual computer scientist. I love that! 

Main takeaway: Computers do EXACTLY what you ask them (unlike people). 

Programming Languages: C


PSET0: Scratch

For the first problem set, all we had to do was make a program in Scratch, a free visual programming language developed by MIT. I am not new to coding, but it was so interesting to see code interpreted visually. I ended up making a "game" where you had to help free the princess by using the arrow keys on a keyboard to navigate her out. She had to navigate the castle without being attacked by a dragon, which was on it's own "random" path and would disappear and reappear at times. The princess had to get past the dragon and retrieve a key. The game wasn't perfect, but it was a great lesson with which to get started.

PSET1: Water, Greedy, Mario (C)

First I had to use C to code a program which would find out the amount of water used per a given amount of time in the shower, easy. Next I created a program that would figure out how to give change back, ie, how to give the fewest number of coins and still give the correct amount of change. This took a little more thought, since you had to try for quarters first, then dimes next, etc, but still pretty easy. The last problem set was to create a simple pyramid like one in a Mario Bros game. This was also a relatively simple problem, although it involved for loops within for loops, more than I had done before. I make the first pyramid simply enough, but when I was tasked with making the identical pyramid, essentially mirrored, I hit a wall. I ran my code over and over again. I rain tests through my code, just to see exactly what it was doing. I finally had to take a week off and come back to it. And then I got it!

PSET2: Initials, Caesar, Vigenere (C)

PSET3: Find, Game of Fifteen (C)

PSET4: Whodunit, Resize, Recover (C)

PSET5: Speller (C)
